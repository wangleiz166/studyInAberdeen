# A. A key part of your work is rolling two-week contracts with clients. That means you work in two-week sprints. What are the implications of this for your work as a team, and for the client? 

For the team:
1. Quick iteration: Short sprints allow the team to iterate quickly, continuously improving and refining the development process.

2. Improved communication: Frequent meetings and discussions help team members communicate with each other, ensuring smooth project progress.

3. Increased transparency: Two-week sprints help the team understand project progress and potential issues, resolving them in a timely manner.

For the client:
1. Timely feedback: Clients can review the team's progress at the end of each sprint and provide timely feedback.

2. Easier changes: Short sprints make it easier to make changes to requirements, allowing clients to adjust priorities at the beginning of each sprint.

3. Reduced risk: A two-week contract reduces the investment risk for clients in case of project failure.

# B. You always work in pairs; both for client and internal work. What does this look like in practice for both coding and non-coding work? 

1. Pair programming: Two developers work together on the same computer, with one writing the code and the other reviewing it. This helps improve code quality, reduce errors, and speed up development.

2. Task sharing: For non-coding work, tasks can be divided into sub-tasks, with each team member responsible for one part. When completing tasks, team members can review and provide feedback to each other.

3. Communication and collaboration: Whether it is coding or non-coding work, both parties need to maintain good communication to ensure that tasks are carried out as planned.

# C. The daily stand-up is for all four of you. Why do you include everyone, even if you might have two different clients? :

1. Team consistency: Even if team members may work for different clients, including all members helps maintain team consistency and common goals.

2. Learning through communication: Including all members can promote the sharing of knowledge and experience, helping the team grow and improve skills.

3. Collaboration: Through the stand-up meeting, team members can learn about the progress and challenges of other projects, so that they can provide support and collaboration when needed.

# D. Once your contract is ‘done’ what happens next with each client with respect to the work you did?

1. Delivery and acceptance: After the contract is completed, you need to deliver the project deliverables to the client, and the client will conduct acceptance to ensure that the delivered work meets the requirements.

2. Documentation and training: Provide the client with relevant documentation of the work done, including user manuals, technical documents, etc. If necessary, training can be provided to the client or their team to ensure that they can use and maintain the product you developed.

3. Contract renewal or new contract: Based on the client's needs and satisfaction, you can discuss with the client to renew the existing contract or sign a new contract to continue providing services to the client.

4. Support and maintenance: After the contract ends, you may need to provide support and maintenance for the client for a period of time to address potential issues and ensure the stable operation of the product.

5. Evaluation and feedback: Collect feedback from the client after the project ends to evaluate the success of the project. This helps you improve the development process and increase client satisfaction in future projects.
