# A. Adopting a two-week contract and two-week sprint in your team has the following effects:

For the team:
1. Quick iteration: Short sprints allow the team to iterate quickly, continuously improving and refining the development process.
2. Improved communication: Frequent meetings and discussions help team members communicate with each other, ensuring smooth project progress.
3. Increased transparency: Two-week sprints help the team understand project progress and potential issues, resolving them in a timely manner.

For the client:
1. Timely feedback: Clients can review the team's progress at the end of each sprint and provide timely feedback.
2. Easier changes: Short sprints make it easier to make changes to requirements, allowing clients to adjust priorities at the beginning of each sprint.
3. Reduced risk: A two-week contract reduces the investment risk for clients in case of project failure.

# B. You always work in pairs in your team, whether it is for clients or internal work. In practice, whether it is coding or non-coding work, this may involve:

1. Pair programming: Two developers work together on the same computer, with one writing the code and the other reviewing it. This helps improve code quality, reduce errors, and speed up development.
2. Task sharing: For non-coding work, tasks can be divided into sub-tasks, with each team member responsible for one part. When completing tasks, team members can review and provide feedback to each other.
3. Communication and collaboration: Whether it is coding or non-coding work, both parties need to maintain good communication to ensure that tasks are carried out as planned.

# C. The daily stand-up meeting includes all four team members for the following reasons:

1. Team consistency: Even if team members may work for different clients, including all members helps maintain team consistency and common goals.
2. Learning through communication: Including all members can promote the sharing of knowledge and experience, helping the team grow and improve skills.
3. Collaboration: Through the stand-up meeting, team members can learn about the progress and challenges of other projects, so that they can provide support and collaboration when needed.
